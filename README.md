# Emoji Jolly Roger Generator

Based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/girlziplocked/status/1370959284545150976). Put in up to four emoji (or whatever) and see them produced as a Jolly Roger.

Issues:
* No styling
* Image downloads don't seem to work on Firefox for Android (works fine on Chrome for Android, haven't tried other mobile devices yet)
* Very limited set of emojis get rendered in the intended style (i.e. the Noto Emoji b/w font)
